  <header><h1>Donald Trump looks very lonely with wiretapping accusation</h1></header>
  <aside><img src="6360139435793044861461393096_Donald-Trump-prune-face.jpg" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></aside>
  <article> <p>The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee joined the chorus of lawmakers stating they are not aware of any evidence supporting President Trump's claim that his campaign headquarters was wiretapped during the presidential election.

Committee chairman Richard Burr on Thursday released a joint statement with Democrat senator Mark Warner, stating they have not seen data supporting Mr Trump's claim.

"Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016," they said. </p>

<p>Senators Burr and Warner are leading the Senate investigation into Russia's suspected interference in the 2016 elections to aid Mr Trump. They are also examining alleged ties between Trump aides and Russian officials. They were joined by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes - leading a similar investigation in the House - who also stated that he has not seen evidence to support the President's complaint that his offices were wiretapped during the campaign.

"I don't think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower," Mr Nunes said. He added that if you are taking President Trump's tweets literally - which he advised people not to do - then "clearly the president was wrong".

House Speaker Paul Ryan - not for for the first time - weighed in on Thursday saying he believes there is no evidence from the intelligence community supporting the idea that Mr Trump was tapped. </p>

<p>Mr Trump's press secretary Sean Spicer insisted on Thursday that the President stands by his allegation - made in a March 4 tweet - that President Barack Obama ordered surveillance of his phones at Trump Tower in New York during the campaign in autumn.

In a remarkably combative exchange with reporters, Mr Spicer was asked whether Mr Trump still believes his claim. "He stands by it," her said.

Yet President Trump admitted on Wednesday night in a Fox News interview that he had no solid proof that Mr Obama ordered an effort to monitor his phone calls. </p>

<p>"I've been reading about things," Mr Trump said. He explained that after noticing an article in The New York Times and commentary by Fox anchor Bret Baier, Mr Trump said he told himself, "Wait a minute, there's a lot of wiretapping being talked about."

In the interview, the President maintained that information would soon be revealed that could prove him right, but he would not explain what that information might be. He said he would be "submitting certain things" to a congressional committee and that he was considering speaking about the topic next week.

"I think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks," Mr Trump said. </p>

<p>Tensions have flared in recent days between lawmakers and the Justice Department on the subject of Russia - especially over FBI Director James Comey's approach to providing Capitol Hill with information about the bureau's probe into Russia's activities in the 2016 campaign.

Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Charles Grassley is holding up the confirmation of deputy attorney general nominee Rod Rosenstein until Mr Comey testifies before his committee on the scope of the FBI's Russia probe.

The tension could break into the open on Monday during a House Intelligx-2ence Committee public hearing on Russia. The hearing will feature Mr Comey and Admiral Mike Rogers, head of the National Security Agency.

It will provide a rare chance for lawmakers to grill the FBI director and other officials in a public setting on the allegations that Russia intervened in the campaign in an attempt to tilt it toward Trump.
